Android app's source folder structure:
1. Java and XML source files: These are the activity and layout files for your app.
2. Android-generated Java files: There are some extra Java files you don’t need to touch that Android Studio generates for you automatically.
3. Resource files: These include default image files for icons, styles your app might use, and any common String values your app might want to look up.
4. Android libraries: In the wizard, you specified the minimum SDK version you want your app to be compatible with. Android Studio makes sure your app includes the relevant Android libraries for that version.
5. Configuration files: The configuration files tell Android what’s actually in the app and how it should run.


AndroidManifest: 
Every Android app must include a file called AndroidManifest.xml at its root. The manifest file contains essential information about the app, such as what components it contains, required libraries, and other declarations.



The activity controls what the app does
Android Studio created an activity for us called MainActivity.java. The activity specifies what the app does and how it should respond to the user.


The layout controls the app's appearance
MainActivity.java specifies that it uses the layout Android Studio created for us called activity_main.xml. The layout specifies what the app looks like.
